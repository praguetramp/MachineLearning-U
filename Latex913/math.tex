\section{Introduction}
In the field of computer science, we encounter various algorithms 
that assist in solving specific practical problems. During this stage, 
it is common to analyze the asymptotic expression of the algorithm in terms of time 
and space complexity to measure its efficiency.



\section{Question}
Please prove the expression ?$\mathbf {O \left ( f\left ( n \right )   + g\left (  n\right ) \right ) =  O\left ( \max \left \{ f\left ( n \right ), g\left ( n \right )   \right \}  \right )}$,
where $f\left ( n \right )$ and $g\left ( n \right )$  are two functions with respect to n. For any n in natural numbers, $f(n) \geq 0$ and $g(n) \geq 0$.

\section{Assumptions}
For any  $f_1(n)\in O(f(n))$, there exists positive constant $c_1$ and a natural number $n_1$ such that for any $n \geq  n_1$, $0\leq f_1(n)\leq c_1\times f(n)$.


Similarly,it can  be derived that for any $g_1(n)\in O (g(n))$,there exists positive constant $c_2$ and a natural number $n_2$ such that for any $n\geq n_2$ ,$0\leq g_1(n)\leq c_2\times g(n)$.


Now let's assume that $c_3 = \max \left \{ c_1,c_2 \right \} , c_4 \geq c_3, n_3 =\max \left \{ n_1,n_2 \right \}$,and  $h(n) = \max \left \{ f(n),g(n) \right \} $.


\section{Proof}
Based on the above assumptions, for any $n \geq n_3$, we have
\begin{eqnarray} 
g_1(n)+f_1(n) &\le& c_1\times f(n)+c_2\times g(n)   \\ 
&\le& c_3\times f(n)+c_3\times g(n) \nonumber \\
&=& c_3\times\left ( f(n)+g(n) \right ) 
\end{eqnarray}


According to the definition of asymptotic upper bound, when $c_4\geq c_3$, the following expression holds.
\begin{eqnarray}
0\le c_3\times \left ( f(n)+g(n) \right )\le c_4\times  \left ( f(n)+g(n) \right ) 
\end{eqnarray}


From expression (3), we obtain $O ( f(n)+g(n))$.Therefore, for all natural numbers n, when $n \geq n_4$, we could deduce that
\begin{eqnarray}
c_4\times  \left ( f(n)+g(n) \right ) &\le& 2\times c_4\times \max \left \{ f(n),g(n) \right \}  \\
&=&2\times c_4 \times h(n)   \\
&=&O \left ( \max \left \{ f(n),g(n) \right \}  \right ) 
\end{eqnarray}


In the above steps, we employed the arithmetic operation expression $O \left ( cf(n) \right )  = O (f(n))$ in asymptotic analysis to facilitate the derivation of expression (6) from expression (5).


Since we have shown that any function in $O \left ( f(n)+g(n) \right )$  is also in $O \left ( \max \left \{ f(n),g(n) \right \}  \right )$  and vice versa,
we can conclude that $O \left ( f(n)+g(n) \right )=  O \left ( \max \left \{ f(n),g(n) \right \}  \right ) $.


Therefore, the given statement has been proven.
\section{Conclusion}
Based on the preceding proof steps,we state the final conclusion that the sum of two polynomial complexities belongs to the maximum polynomial complexity among them.
